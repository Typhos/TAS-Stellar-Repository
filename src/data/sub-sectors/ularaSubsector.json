        "<p>Skoll is a harsh, arid planet ruled by a feudal system under <strong>Sarrax Kaine Mylarron</strong>. The population, numbering in the millions, is divided among baronial territories, with Siron City as the planetary capital. The yearly Tournament of Blades serves as a violent yet formalized way to resolve disputes, while day-to-day life is dominated by rigid social hierarchies and cordial manners. Advanced technology is rare and imported, with the planet's own industrial capabilities stuck at an early 20th-century level. Nomadic tribes and political intrigue provide both opportunity and danger for those visiting this turbulent world.</p>",
        "<h3>Environment and Biome</h3><p>Skoll is a harsh, arid world with a thin, breathable atmosphere that sustains limited life. Its gravity (0.45g) and minimal water (11%) have shaped a landscape of rocky plains, rugged highlands, and sparse low-grav forests. The extreme temperature shifts between day and night, combined with frequent dust storms, make life outside fortified settlements difficult. Isolated lakes and underground aquifers provide the bulk of the planet's water, and agriculture is a challenging endeavor, relying on hardy crops and minimal irrigation.</p>",
        "<h3>Society and Culture</h3><p>Skoll's feudal structure reflects the Imperium's tendency to delegate planetary governance to local rulers. The planet is ruled by <strong>Sarrax Kaine Mylarron</strong>, who resides in <strong>Siron City</strong>, the planetary capital and starport. His authority is recognized by the Imperium, but his barons wield significant independence, often acting as miniature warlords. These barons oversee their own territories, collecting taxes, maintaining militias, and enforcing their own laws. Disputes between barons are theoretically mediated by the Knight, though in practice, intrigue and subtle power plays are common.</p><p>The society of Skoll has evolved to cope with the constant threat of conflict. To curb the endless warring that once ravaged the planet, a yearly Tournament of Blades is held. This event, an orgy of ritualized hyperviolence, serves as a way for barons and their vassals to settle disputes without descending into open war. Dueling, jousting, and melee competitions are used to mediate conflicts ranging from territorial disputes to personal vendettas. Barons caught engaging in conflict outside of the tournament are occasionally punished, though their influence often shields them from execution.</p><p>At the lower levels of society, most day-to-day violence is ignored by the ruling class unless it threatens stability. Outcasts and nomadic tribes, living beyond the reach of baronial rule, are often hunted as part of military training exercises, their existence treated as an inconvenience at best and prey at worst. These brutal hunts are a grim reminder of the planet's feudal hierarchy.</p><p>In sharp contrast to this violence, Skollans value cordiality and manners in their personal interactions. Public displays of insult or anger are considered deeply uncivilized, replaced instead by exaggerated gestures of shunning or ostentatious formality to express displeasure. This formalized politeness is seen even during the Tournament of Blades, where rivals exchange respectful greetings before attempting to kill one another.</p>",
        "<h3>Technology and Economy</h3><p>Skoll operates at a TL 5 industrial level, with steam power, basic chemical industries, and primitive firearms. While the people are aware of higher technology through their contact with the Imperium, they lack the infrastructure to produce it locally. The planetary starport, though classified as D-level, functions as a critical connection to the galactic trade network, importing advanced weapons, medical supplies, and machinery that the feudal lords rely on to maintain their rule.</p><p>The economy is primarily agrarian, with some mining and light industrial production. Trade within the planet is conducted through baronial fiefdoms, where peasants toil under harsh conditions to support their lords. Mercenaries and adventurers frequently find work here, hired to protect caravans or enforce the whims of the nobility.</p>"

        "<h3>Introduction</h3><p><strong>Quolir</strong> is a space-based society orbiting a barren planet, its population (50,000) residing entirely in the last surviving orbital habitat, <strong>Haven</strong>. Originally one of six massive stations known as the <strong>Sides</strong>, Haven now struggles under severe overpopulation, resource shortages, and the constant challenge of maintaining its failing infrastructure. Despite its high technological base, most of the population lives under precarious conditions, relying on salvaged components and makeshift repairs to keep essential systems operational.</p>",

        "<h3>Geography and Environment</h3><p>Quolir itself is a lifeless rock with no atmosphere, no surface water, and no significant geological value. The real focus of the system is the network of orbital habitats known as the <strong>Sides</strong>, which were originally positioned in geosynchronous orbit in a hexagonal configuration around the planet. These stations were designed as self-sustaining environments, each with a specialized mission and role.</p><p>Today, only <strong>Haven</strong> remains fully inhabited. The wreckage of the other five—<strong>Tranquility, Serenity, Oasis, Sanctuary,</strong> and <strong>Elysium</strong>—still lingers in orbit, serving as dangerous but necessary salvage grounds. Some rumors persist that remnants of their original populations may still be clinging to life in the ruins, though no verified contact has been made.</p>",

        "<h3>History</h3><p>The <strong>Six Sides Project</strong> was an ambitious colonization effort meant to establish a fully self-sufficient orbital society above Quolir. Each station was designed with a distinct purpose, from research to agriculture to industry. However, a catastrophic event—whether war, system failure, or external sabotage—led to the destruction or abandonment of five of the Sides, leaving <strong>Haven</strong> as the last functional habitat.</p><p>With a population several times greater than its original design capacity, Haven has become a precarious marvel of engineering, surviving only through relentless jury-rigging, dangerous salvage missions, and strict recycling efforts.</p>",

        "<h3>Government and Politics</h3><p>Haven has no centralized government in the traditional sense. The only law that exists is maintaining the station. Any changes affecting the whole of Haven are only enacted through <strong>popular vote</strong>, leading to an often chaotic and slow-moving decision-making process. Individual factions and guilds hold significant sway, but none can truly claim dominance over the station.</p><p>Politics on Haven is often cutthroat, with guilds, salvage teams, and supply factions vying for control over resources. Power is measured in access to food, water, air, and habitable space rather than political influence.</p>",

        "<h3>Economy and Trade</h3><p>Despite its severe resource scarcity, Haven maintains an advanced technological base. The original infrastructure of the Sides was designed to support a far smaller population with minimal imports. Today, however, the economy is a fragile balancing act of external trade, internal recycling, and salvage operations.</p><p>The guilds that manufacture products function less like corporations and more like <strong>tribal clans</strong>, defending their territories and resources fiercely. Business rivalries are known to escalate beyond economic competition, occasionally turning into open sabotage or armed skirmishes.</p><p>With food, water, and air constantly in short supply, <strong>piracy is a known occurrence</strong> in the surrounding space, as desperate factions or rogue elements seize cargo ships carrying critical resources. Some off-world traders deal with Haven only under heavy escort.</p>",

        "<h3>Technology and Infrastructure</h3><p>While Haven is officially classified at <strong>Tech Level 9</strong>, much of its infrastructure is barely functional. The station was designed to operate with a single orbital solar array, but with the increased power demand, two additional arrays have been salvaged and repurposed to keep critical systems running.</p><p>The average citizen is highly skilled in <strong>jury-rigging</strong> and improvising repairs, as maintenance of life-support systems is a daily struggle. While high technology exists, it is often out of reach for most inhabitants, reserved for station-critical functions.</p><p>Salvage operations are a fundamental part of Haven's continued survival. Crews regularly venture into the wreckage of the other Sides, recovering materials, equipment, and sometimes even lost data caches. These missions are extremely hazardous, as unstable debris fields, rogue drones, and the possibility of encountering hidden survivors make them unpredictable at best.</p>",

        "<h3>Imperial Presence and Strategic Importance</h3><p>Despite its internal struggles, Quolir remains strategically significant due to its location on an <strong>Xboat route</strong> and the presence of both an <strong>Imperial Navy Base</strong> and a <strong>Scout Services station</strong>. These facilities serve as staging points for Imperial operations in the region, providing fleet support, reconnaissance, and emergency logistics for vessels in need of repairs or refueling.</p><p>The <strong>Imperial Navy Base</strong> is primarily tasked with patrolling the sector, deterring piracy, and ensuring the continued function of the Xboat network. While it maintains a small permanent fleet, the base regularly sees passing warships stopping for resupply or minor overhauls.</p><p>The <strong>Scout Services station</strong> operates independently of Haven's civilian population, focusing on deep-space surveys, sensor relays, and maintaining contact with outlying systems. Scouts often hire local salvage crews for specialized recovery missions, making their station one of the few reliable sources of outside employment for Haven's inhabitants.</p><p>The presence of these Imperial facilities offers a degree of stability, but they largely keep to their own operations, interacting with Haven only when necessary. The Imperium has little interest in governing the station directly, leaving its internal affairs to the whims of its population.</p>",

        "<h3>Society and Culture</h3><p>Haven's culture is defined by scarcity, pragmatism, and survival. Resourcefulness is valued above all else, and those who can repair, repurpose, or engineer solutions are among the most respected members of society. Due to the constant resource struggle, <strong>green spaces</strong> are considered sacred. Destroying trees or plant life is one of the few universally recognized crimes, as they are essential for air regeneration and food production.</p><p>Despite this, ongoing debates rage over whether more green space should be cleared to accommodate the growing population. Some argue that increased food production will help alleviate shortages, while others insist that further destruction will push the station beyond its sustainability limits.</p><p>Travel off-station is rare, and those who leave are often regarded with suspicion or jealousy. While some see them as adventurers bringing back valuable goods, others view them as abandoning their responsibilities to Haven.</p>",

        "<h3>Law and Order</h3><p>Haven has <strong>no formal legal system</strong>. With no central enforcement agency, justice is either handled through mob rule, guild arbitration, or direct retaliation. The only universally recognized law is that no one may compromise the stability of the station. Major crimes, such as deliberate sabotage of life-support systems or destruction of critical resources, are met with immediate and often lethal punishment.</p><p>Guild conflicts sometimes escalate into outright warfare, but open battles are rare due to the potential for catastrophic station damage. Instead, disputes are often settled through economic pressure, assassinations, or rigged votes.</p>"

Over time, the planet's salt deposits became its primary economic asset, leading to the rise of a trade-based society centered around <strong>Gateway</strong>. The starport grew beyond its original function, becoming a symbol of unity and a gathering place for political and cultural events. Today, Asherah remains a frontier world, its people deeply bound to tradition and communal survival.</p>",

        "<h3>Government and Politics</h3><p>Asherah is governed as a <strong>participatory democracy</strong> (Gov 2), where major decisions are made through open forums and community gatherings, typically held in <strong>Gateway</strong>. The lack of formal governance beyond the city limits results in a loose network of settlements operating under mutual agreements. While there are no formal laws (Law Level 0), social norms and collective accountability maintain order. Personal disputes are resolved through negotiation, mediation, or, in extreme cases, exile.</p>",

        "<h3>Economy and Trade</h3><p>The planet's primary export is <strong>salt</strong>, which is not only a trade commodity but also an integral part of Asherahian culture. Salt is used for preservation, seasoning, and cleaning, with idioms and insults woven around its presence in daily life. Trade with off-world merchants is vital, as Asherah lacks industrial infrastructure and must import most advanced goods and equipment.</p><p>One of the more unusual trade rituals is the <strong>'Gift of Preservation'</strong>, in which a departing starship is given a sealed bottle of Asherah's ocean water. The tradition serves both as a symbolic farewell and as a mark of goodwill for returning travelers.</p>",

        "<h3>Culture and Society</h3><p>Asherahian society is structured around tradition and ritual, with a strong emphasis on community survival. <strong>Gateway</strong> is more than a starport—it is the heart of Asherahian identity, where ceremonies, trade deals, and social gatherings take place. Arrivals and departures of ships are often marked by public observances, reinforcing the collective spirit of the planet.</p><p>Asherahians value self-sufficiency and perseverance, yet they are also known for their hospitality. Visitors are often welcomed with formalized exchanges of goods or drinks, particularly at establishments like <strong>The Brine Barrel</strong>, Concord's oldest cantina. Here, the 'Gift of Preservation' tradition grants returning Asherahians a free round, while non-natives receive discounted drinks in recognition of their journey.</p>",

        "<h3>Major Settlements</h3><p>The vast majority of Asherah's population resides in <strong>Concord</strong>, a sprawling city located on the coast of the planet's only significant ocean. Built for function rather than aesthetics, Concord features low, sturdy buildings designed to withstand extreme temperatures and high winds. Infrastructure is highly localized, with technology levels dropping sharply outside the city center.</p><p>Beyond Concord, scattered towns and isolated homesteads persist through sheer determination. One of the most notable remote sites is the <strong>Research Station</strong> on the planet's far side, where scientists study the preserved remains of ancient marine ecosystems trapped in the salt flats. This floating laboratory, built on inflatable pontoons, is a marvel of ingenuity, capable of lowering itself to avoid destruction during high wind storms.</p>",

        "<h3>Technology and Infrastructure</h3><p>Asherah operates at <strong>Tech Level 4</strong>, with industrial capabilities comparable to early modern technological eras. While Gateway maintains a functional power grid and limited mechanization, the further one travels from the city, the more primitive life becomes. Most settlements rely on basic tools, barter systems, and self-sufficiency to survive.</p><p>Air-raft racing is a popular sport on Asherah, with events frequently held over the <strong>Bitterwater Shoal</strong>, a shallow expanse of water southwest of Concord. The location is favored due to its low risk of total loss—though crashes are still deadly, the wreckage is often retrievable.</p>",

        "<h3>Law and Order</h3><p>With a law level of 0, Asherah has no formal restrictions on weaponry, behavior, or commerce. However, social accountability and community reputation play significant roles in maintaining order. Those who disrupt the peace or violate local customs find themselves unwelcome in Concord, effectively exiled by public sentiment.</p><p>Violence is rare within the city, but disputes outside of Concord are often settled informally, and personal responsibility is a cornerstone of Asherahian ethics. Most citizens take pride in their ability to self-govern and view excessive regulation as unnecessary.</p>"
